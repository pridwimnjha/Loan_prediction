# Loan Prediction Using Machine Learning

## 📌 Project Overview

This project aims to predict whether a loan application will be approved based on applicant details such as income, credit history, employment status, and loan amount. Loan approval prediction is a common use case in the banking and finance sector, where machine learning can help automate decision-making and reduce risk.

## 🎯 Objectives

* Perform **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** to uncover insights.
* Apply **data preprocessing** (handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, scaling, etc.).
* Train and evaluate multiple **classification models**.
* Compare performance using metrics such as **accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score**.
* Provide **feature importance analysis** to improve interpretability.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

* **Language:** Python
* **Libraries:** NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-learn, XGBoost
* **Environment:** Jupyter Notebook

## 📂 Dataset

The dataset contains loan application records with attributes such as:

* Applicant Income
* Co-applicant Income
* Loan Amount
* Loan Term
* Credit History
* Gender, Education, Employment Status, etc.
* Target: **Loan\_Status (Approved / Not Approved)**

## 🔑 Approach

1. **Data Preprocessing**

   * Handle missing values
   * Encode categorical variables
   * Normalize/scale features

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**

   * Distribution of numerical and categorical variables
   * Relationship between applicant details and loan approval

3. **Model Development**

   * Logistic Regression
   * Decision Tree
   * Random Forest
   * XGBoost
   * Comparison of models using evaluation metrics

4. **Model Evaluation**

   * Confusion Matrix
   * Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-score
   * ROC-AUC curve

## 📊 Results

* The best performing model achieved **XX% accuracy** on the test dataset.
* Key factors influencing loan approval included **credit history, applicant income, and loan amount**.

## 🚀 How to Run

1. Clone this repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/Loan-Prediction-ML.git
   cd Loan-Prediction-ML
   ```
2. Install dependencies:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
3. Run the Jupyter Notebook:

   ```bash
   jupyter notebook LoanPrediction.ipynb
   ```

## 📌 Future Improvements

* Deploy the model using Flask/Django for web-based predictions.
* Apply advanced ensemble models or deep learning techniques.
* Incorporate external financial data for better accuracy.


Do you want me to also **extract the key results (best model + accuracy/metrics)** from your notebook and insert them into the README automatically so it looks more complete for recruiters?
